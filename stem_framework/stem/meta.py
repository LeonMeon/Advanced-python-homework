'''
conception of metadata and metadata processor
metadata - user-defined tree of values (to cache analysis
results or send instructions to remote computing node)
metadata processor principle - during the
processing of data, only immutable initial data and metadata are allowed to be used as input -> declarative
approach of describing data (no scripts, processing description in the form of metadata)
